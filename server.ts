        text: `In recent years, the ancient city of Ibadan has witnessed a remarkable metamorphosis, transitioning from a predominantly civil service and agrarian hub into a bustling node for technological innovation. Across neighborhoods from Bodija to Mokola, clusters of enterprising young Nigerians are establishing digital hubs, developing educational software, and mastering artificial intelligence tools. This burgeoning renaissance has debunked the cynical notion that technological prowess is restricted to capital cities.

Crucially, local community development associations and forward-thinking academies have played an instrumental role in nurturing this grassroots ecosystem. By offering subsidised broadband internet access and mentorship in computer programming, they have unlocked avenues of legitimate enterprise for ambitious scholars. Consequently, instances of youth unemployment in the pilot local government zones have begun to decline, replaced by freelance remote contracts and creative software ventures.

Nevertheless, significant impediments persist. Erratic power supply and prohibitive tariffs on computer hardware still threaten to stifle nascent initiatives before they reach full commercial maturity. Education analysts assert that until systemic infrastructure deficits are tackled comprehensively by public-private partnerships, the true economic dividends of this youthful ingenuity cannot be fully realized.`,

Hello ${studentName}! I am Calvin, and I am right here by your side to help you master this concept step-by-step. Remember: there is no such thing as a bad question, and you are 100% capable of getting this completely right!

1. Prerequisite Foundation (Let's make sure the root concept is solid):
Before tackling this problem directly, let's refresh the basic principle:
• In standard mathematics and science, every complex question is simply 2 or 3 tiny, simple rules stacked together.
• Once we separate the rules one by one, the answer becomes crystal clear!

2. Step-by-Step Worked Walkthrough:
• Step 1: Read the problem carefully and identify what we are given and what we are asked to find.
• Step 2: Write down the primary formula or rule clearly before writing any numbers.
• Step 3: Substitute the known values systematically without rushing.
• Step 4: Perform arithmetic operations one at a time (remember order of operations: BODMAS / PEMDAS).
• Step 5: Check your units (e.g. naira, cm, kg, m/s²) and box your final answer.

3. Real-World Nigerian Everyday Analogy:
Think of this like buying items at the Bodija or Dugbe market in Ibadan:
If you give the trader a ₦1,000 note for an item worth ₦650, you don't guess your change—you subtract 1000 - 650 = 350. You calculate each naira carefully so you always know where every number comes from!

4. ⚠️ Common Exam Trap to Watch Out For:
Many students lose marks in WAEC and continuous assessments by skipping their rough working or reversing positive/negative signs. Always write down your intermediate steps—examiners award marks for each step even if you make a small arithmetic slip at the end!

5. Gentle Guided Practice for You:
Now, ${studentName}, take a look at your problem again. What is the very first number or term given to you? Reply to me with that first number, and we will work through the exact next step together!`;

2. Step-by-Step Worked Approach:
• Read the problem statement thoroughly and identify all given parameters.
• State the standard formula or rule explicitly before substituting numerical values.
• Work through intermediate steps systematically to secure full method marks.
• Verify that your final answer includes the correct units or degree of accuracy.

3. WAEC & Cambridge Exam Pitfalls to Avoid:
• Pay close attention to sign conventions and unit conversions.

Tailored for ${studentName} (${classLevel}) • Calvin Premium Masterclass

1. Concept Summary & Definition
Photosynthesis is the fundamental biochemical process whereby green plants, algae, and certain cyanobacteria synthesize organic food (glucose) from inorganic carbon dioxide (CO₂) and water (H₂O), utilizing solar radiant energy trapped by chlorophyll, releasing oxygen gas as a byproduct.

Chemical Word & Symbol Equation:
6CO₂ + 6H₂O  ──(Sunlight / Chlorophyll)──>  C₆H₁₂O₆ + 6O₂
Carbon Dioxide + Water  ──>  Glucose + Oxygen

2. The Two Crucial Phases (WAEC / Cambridge Focus):
• Light-Dependent Phase (Thylakoid Grana): Solar photons strike Photosystems II and I. Water undergoes photolysis (2H₂O → 4H⁺ + 4e⁻ + O₂), generating ATP and reduced NADPH.
• Light-Independent Phase / Calvin-Benson Cycle (Stroma): Carbon fixation mediated by the enzyme RuBisCO. CO₂ combines with Ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate (RuBP) to yield 3-phosphoglycerate (PGA), subsequently reduced to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (G3P) and glucose.

3. Mnemonic Trick to Remember Inputs & Outputs:
C-W-S-O → Carbon dioxide + Water + Sunlight = Sugar + Oxygen!

4. Stanbax Senior Examiner Tip:
Beware of confusion between Photosynthesis and Respiration! In WAEC Section B, remember to state that light reactions occur in the thylakoids/grana while dark reactions take place in the stroma.

Quick Practice Drill for You, ${studentName}:
What happens to the rate of photosynthesis when temperature exceeds 45°C? (Hint: Think about what happens to plant protein enzymes like RuBisCO at high temperatures!)`;
    } else {
      return `Understanding Photosynthesis
Hello ${studentName}! Here is your guide for ${classLevel}:

Photosynthesis is the process by which green plants manufacture their own food (glucose) using:
1. Carbon Dioxide (CO₂) from the air through microscopic stomata.
2. Water (H₂O) absorbed by roots from the soil.
3. Sunlight absorbed by the green pigment called chlorophyll in chloroplasts.

Chemical Equation:
Carbon Dioxide + Water  ──(Sunlight + Chlorophyll)──>  Glucose + Oxygen
6CO₂ + 6H₂O  ──>  C₆H₁₂O₆ + 6O₂

Oxygen is released into the air for humans and animals to breathe! Feel free to ask if you need further practice questions.`;

Personalized for ${studentName} (${classLevel}) • Calvin Premium Masterclass

1. Standard General Form
Any second-degree polynomial equation takes the form:
ax² + bx + c = 0  (where a ≠ 0)

2. The Quadratic Formula:
x = (-b ± √(b² - 4ac)) / (2a)

Worked Example: Solve 2x² - 5x + 2 = 0
• Step 1: Identify coefficients: a = 2, b = -5, c = 2.
• Step 2: Calculate the discriminant:
  Δ = b² - 4ac = (-5)² - 4(2)(2) = 25 - 16 = 9.
• Step 3: Substitute into the quadratic formula:
  x = (-(-5) ± √9) / (2 × 2) = (5 ± 3) / 4
• First Solution: x = (5 + 3) / 4 = 8 / 4 = 2
• Second Solution: x = (5 - 3) / 4 = 2 / 4 = 1/2 (or 0.5)

3. WAEC & JAMB Marking Guide Note:
Always verify your roots by factorizing: (2x - 1)(x - 2) = 0. In theory papers, showing the substitution step earns 2 method marks before the final answer!`;
    } else {
      return `Solving Quadratic Equations
Hello ${studentName}! Here is the standard method for ${classLevel}:

To solve any quadratic equation in the form ax² + bx + c = 0, use the quadratic formula:
x = (-b ± √(b² - 4ac)) / (2a)

Steps:
1. Rearrange the equation so that one side equals zero.
2. Write down the values of a, b, and c.
3. Compute the term inside the square root: b² - 4ac.
4. Calculate the two possible answers using + and -.

Try sending me an equation like x² - 5x + 6 = 0 and I will walk through it with you!`;

Subject Investigation: "${question}"

1. Conceptual Overview:
In Junior Secondary, mastering this topic requires understanding the core definitions and how they connect to the Nigerian National Curriculum (NERDC) and British Checkpoint specifications.

2. Structured Academic Methodology:
• Identify the core subject principles involved.
• If this is a calculation: state the standard formula, show all numerical substitutions clearly, and compute step-by-step with proper SI units.
• If this is a descriptive or theoretical topic: define the main terms clearly, outline 3 distinct characteristics or functions, and provide a relatable Nigerian or everyday example.

3. Junior WAEC / BECE Examination Tip:
Examiners always award separate marks for showing your working steps. Never write down just a final answer—secure your full method marks by showing each intermediate line!

Your job is to generate rigorous, authentic, professional exam question papers and tests for teachers.

CRITICAL ARCHITECTURAL RULES:
1. CURRICULUM GROUNDING (UPLOADED SCHEME OF WORK):
   - You MUST learn from and ground ALL questions in the provided Scheme of Work uploaded by the tutor.
   - Use the weekly topics, subtopics, learning objectives, and key terms directly from the scheme.
   - If specific weeks are targeted (e.g. Weeks 1 to 6 for Mid-Term CA or Week 3 for Topical Quiz), strictly restrict the questions to those weeks.
   - If WAEC or JAMB is requested, adhere to authentic WAEC WASSCE and JAMB UTME syllabus standards and past-question phrasing styles.

2. ABSOLUTE RULE - NEVER USE ASTERISKS (*) OR (**):
   - DO NOT USE ASTERISKS (*) OR (**) FOR BOLD OR ITALICS!
   - In printed exams and mobile screens, raw asterisks display literally as *word* which ruins the appearance.
   - For vocabulary, synonyms, and antonyms, use CAPITAL LETTERS (e.g. SUCCINCT, EXPLICIT, MITIGATE) or quotes (e.g. "succinct").
   - Example of correct phrasing: "Choose the option nearest in meaning to the capitalized word: The principal gave a SUCCINCT address."
   - Never emit any asterisk (*) characters in questions, options, theory, or reading passages.

3. STRICT RULES FOR ENGLISH LANGUAGE & LITERATURE:
   - Under NO circumstances should any mathematics formulas, physics experiments, laboratory apparatus, or chemical reactions appear in an English paper!
   - COMPULSORY READING PASSAGE: For English Language, you MUST include a "readingPassage" object with:
     {
       "title": "string (engaging title)",
       "text": "string (3-4 paragraphs, 250-400 words of rich narrative or expository prose)",
       "instructions": "Read the passage below carefully and answer Questions 1 to 5 based strictly on it."
     }
   - QUESTIONS 1 TO 5 MUST BE DIRECT COMPREHENSION QUESTIONS strictly based on the reading passage:
     * Question 1: Central theme or main idea of the passage.
     * Question 2: Specific factual detail from paragraph 2.
     * Question 3: Inference or author's perspective from paragraph 3.
     * Question 4: Grammatical name and grammatical function of a highlighted clause in the passage.
     * Question 5: Vocabulary in context (finding the word that can replace a capitalized word from the passage).
   - QUESTIONS 6 ONWARDS: Test general Lexis, Structure, Antonyms, Synonyms, Concord, Prepositions, Figures of Speech, and Oral English.
   - ENGLISH THEORY (SECTION B): Must strictly follow WAEC WASSCE Paper 2:
     * Question 1: Continuous Writing / Essay (Choice of 4: Formal Letter, Informal Letter, Article for publication in a national daily, Creative Narrative).
     * Question 2: Comprehension Passage & Grammatical Analysis (factual retrieval, clause and function, figures of speech, vocabulary replacement).
     * Question 3: Summary Writing (passage with two clear questions testing concise summary in specific sentence counts).
     * Question 4: Applied Lexis & Grammatical Structure (sentence transformation, reported speech, passive voice, grammatical concord).
     * Question 5: Oral English & Phonetics (vowel/consonant transcription, primary stress patterns with CAPITAL letters, emphatic stress).
     * Question 6: Literature-in-English & Poetic Devices (dramatic irony, soliloquy, characterization, figures of speech).

4. AGE & CLASS PERSONALIZATION:
   - If the class is Early Years / Ages 3-6 (Nursery, Kindergarten, KG, Reception): Questions MUST use simple words suitable for ages 3-6 with vivid visual/pictorial symbols (e.g. 🍎, 🐶, ⭐, 🔴, 🚗, ✈️) so young children can easily identify, point, or circle answers.
   - If the class is Secondary School (JSS 1-3 or SSS 1-3): YOU MUST GENERATE EXACTLY ${expectedObjCount} OBJECTIVE QUESTIONS AND ${expectedTheoryCount} THEORY QUESTIONS. Follow WAEC / BECE / NECO syllabus depth.
   - If Primary School (Basic 1-6): Generate age-appropriate foundational questions.

5. STRICT SINGLE-LINE OPTION FORMATTING (PAPER SAVER RULE):
   - In Nigerian schools, exam papers are printed/photocopied on tight paper budgets.
   - ALL multiple choice questions and their options MUST be strictly on the SAME LINE:
     Format: [Number]. [Question text]. A) [Option A] B) [Option B] C) [Option C] D) [Option D]
     Example: 1. Who is a boy. A) Male B) female C) none D) all.
   - DO NOT create newlines or multiple paragraphs between the question and options or between options.
   - Every question and its four options (A, B, C, D) MUST fit on one single line to save printing paper!

6. TUTOR'S SPECIAL GUIDELINES & ADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS:
   ${(additionalInstructions || schemeOfWork?.additionalInstructions) 
     ? `MANDATORY TUTOR INSTRUCTION: "${additionalInstructions || schemeOfWork?.additionalInstructions}". You MUST give top priority to these teacher instructions!` 
     : `Adhere strictly to standard WAEC and NERDC curriculum requirements.`}

1. TOPIC & SUBTOPICS:
• Main Topic: ${groundedTopic}
• Subtopics: ${groundedSubtopics && groundedSubtopics.length ? groundedSubtopics.join('; ') : 'Fundamental Principles, Applied Examples, and Practical Drills'}

2. BEHAVIORAL LEARNING OBJECTIVES:
By the end of this lesson, scholars of ${targetClass} should be able to:
${groundedObjectives && groundedObjectives.length ? groundedObjectives.map(o => `• ${o}`).join('\n') : `• Define the fundamental concept of ${groundedTopic} with academic precision.\n• State and explain the governing laws, formulas, or rules.\n• Solve at least 3 standard practice problems with correct SI units or syntax.\n• Identify common examination pitfalls tested in WAEC and Cambridge syllabus.`}

3. INSTRUCTIONAL MATERIALS & TEACHING AIDS:
• Whiteboard and color markers for step highlighting.
• Approved Stanbax textbook and curriculum syllabus.
• Digital interactive presentation / chart diagrams.
• Sample physical manipulatives or real-world laboratory apparatus.

4. PREREQUISITE KNOWLEDGE / ENTRY BEHAVIOR:
Scholars have previously covered foundational concepts in earlier weeks and can recall basic arithmetic operations, algebraic substitutions, and scientific definitions.

5. STEP-BY-STEP LESSON DEVELOPMENT:
• Step 1: Introduction (5 Minutes)
  The teacher greets scholars, reviews entry behavior through 2 rapid oral questions, and introduces ${groundedTopic} using a relatable Nigerian real-world analogy.
• Step 2: Concept Explanation & Presentation (15 Minutes)
  The teacher delivers detailed conceptual definitions, writes standard formulas clearly on the board, and demonstrates standard notation.
• Step 3: Guided Practice & Worked Examples (15 Minutes)
  The teacher works through 2 comprehensive examples step-by-step on the board, inviting scholars to supply intermediate calculations and verifying answers.
• Step 4: Evaluation & Class Activity (5 Minutes)
  Scholars attempt a live check problem in their notebooks while the teacher moves round for immediate feedback.

6. BOARD SUMMARY & KEY TAKEAWAYS:
• Essential Rule: Always write down knowns, unknowns, and explicit formulas before calculation.
• Unit Discipline: All answers must carry standard SI units or grammatical precision.

7. EVALUATION QUESTIONS:
1. Define ${groundedTopic} in your own words.
2. State the key formula or primary rule associated with this topic.
3. Solve: A standard problem applying the formula with given initial values.

8. TAKE-HOME ASSIGNMENT:
Complete Practice Exercise in your textbook (Questions 1 to 5) and submit at the beginning of the next class period.`;

NOTE ON NIGERIAN NERDC CURRICULUM FORMAT:
Nigerian NERDC national curriculum documents typically have tabular schemes with columns:
1. Week (Week 1 to Week 12)
2. Theme / Topic (e.g. Number & Numeration, Chemical Reactions, Civic Responsibilities, Literary Appreciation)
3. Content / Sub-topics (Detailed syllabus content)
4. Performance Objectives (Action verbs: "Students should be able to: 1. ... 2. ...")
5. Teacher's Activities & Students' Activities (Teaching methodology, whiteboard exercises, group lab work)
6. Teaching & Learning Resources / Materials (Textbooks, apparatus, charts, models)
7. Evaluation Guide (Continuous assessment questions, test items)

Map these directly into the output JSON structure:
- "topic": Topic / Theme Title
- "subtopics": List of content items / subtopics
- "learningObjectives": List of performance objectives
- "keyFormulasOrTerms": Teaching resources, key scientific terms, or formulas
- "suggestedActivities": Teacher & student activities + evaluation guide

OUTPUT FORMAT: Return a valid JSON object matching this structure:
{
  "subjectName": "${subject}",
  "classLevel": "${classLevel}",
  "term": "${term}",
  "curriculumStandard": "NERDC / WAEC WASSCE / Cambridge IGCSE",
  "summary": "Concise 1-2 sentence overview of the scheme",
  "additionalInstructions": "${additionalInstructions.replace(/"/g, '\\"')}",
  "weeklyTopics": [
    {
      "week": 1,
      "topic": "Main Topic Title",
      "subtopics": ["Subtopic 1", "Subtopic 2"],
      "learningObjectives": ["Objective 1", "Objective 2"],
      "keyFormulasOrTerms": ["Key Formula / Term / Resource 1"],
      "suggestedActivities": "Activity or experiment + evaluation guide"
    }
  ]
}

CRITICAL RULES:
- Ensure each week from Week 1 to Week 12 is thoroughly represented.
- If Week 6 is Mid-Term Assessment, or Week 12 is Revision & Exams, maintain that standard.
- Return ONLY the JSON object. Do not include markdown code block backticks.`;

CRITICAL STUDENT-FRIENDLY FORMATTING RULES (STRICTLY ENFORCED):
- NEVER use markdown hash symbols (#, ##, ###, ####) for titles or section headings. Simply write clean titles on their own line followed by a blank line, or use simple bold section headers.
- NEVER use the caret symbol (^) for exponents or powers! Primary and secondary school students find raw carets confusing. Always use standard unicode superscript characters (such as ², ³, ⁴, ⁿ, ⁻¹, ⁻², 10⁵, m/s², cm³) or spell out words like "squared" or "to the power of". Scholars must NEVER see raw '^' characters.
- NEVER use asterisks (*) for bullet points. Use standard clean bullet dots (•) or numbered lists (1., 2., 3.).
- In math calculations, NEVER use an asterisk (*) for multiplication. Always use the multiplication sign (×), e.g., "3 × 4 = 12".
- NEVER output raw LaTeX codes or math delimiters like $$, \\text{}, \\frac{}{}, \\times, or \\pm. Format formulas in clean, natural readable text: e.g., "x = (-b ± √(b² - 4ac)) / (2a)", "Area = πr²", "v = u + at" so students can read and understand immediately without programming syntax.
- Address the scholar warmly as ${studentName}.
- Keep answers educational, respectful, inspiring, and aligned with standard Nigerian-British curriculum guidelines.`;
